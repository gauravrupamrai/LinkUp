Of course! Here's a summarized description of the folder structure:

## Folder Structure Overview
- Root Directory: Contains the main entry point of the website, index.html.

- css/: This directory houses all the stylesheets for the website. Each page or feature has its dedicated CSS file, ensuring modular and organized styling. For instance, about.css contains styles specific to the About page, while index.css is for the main landing page.

- images/: This is the central repository for all visual assets. It's further organized into subdirectories based on the type or usage of the images:

  - aboutUS/, cityscapes-locations/, etc.: These folders categorize images based on their relevance to specific sections or features of the website.
  - Standalone image files like home-bg.jpg or Logo_Normal.png are directly placed in the images/ directory, likely because they are used across multiple pages or have general relevance.

- webpages/: Contains the HTML files for different sections or pages of the website, other than the main landing page. It also has subdirectories like locations/ and workspaces/, suggesting that these sections might have multiple related files or further categorization.

## Technologies Used
